# Block-Game

A basic web game build with vanilla JavaScript and HTML. In this program you will learn to use Canvas API.

This game is inspired from a game I found on the Play Store called `Sqube Darkness`. This was an attempt to build similar game for the web.

The website is live [here](https://Shashank-Salian.github.io/block-game/)
